## 2026-06-22 - [Refactoring N+1 Query in SupplierOrderHandler]
**Learning:** Found an N+1 issue in `SupplierOrderHandler` (inside `api/barcode.go`) where multiple database inserts were performed in a loop (`tx.Exec`) for each generated barcode when ordering copies. Refactored this to use a single bulk insert operation via `tx.CopyFrom` combined with `pgx.CopyFromRows`.
**Action:** Always prefer `pgx.CopyFromRows` for batch database creation or insertion. This drastically reduces database round-trips when processing larger quantities (like bulk ordering of books).
